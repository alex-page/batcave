# Batcave

> ðŸ¦‡ Automated set up of ubuntu desktop for a development environment


# Get started

Once ubuntu desktop is installed open the terminal and run:

```
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alex-page/batcave/master/init.sh | sh
```

# Usage

This configuration is built for myself. 

Please feel free to fork it and change the [variables ( vars/main.yml )](vars/main.yml) and [`tasks ( config.yml )`](config.yml) to suit your needs.

This project uses github [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) to automatically add ssh and gpg configuration to the ubuntu desktop environment and github account. You must provide an encrypted token with the permissions `admin:gpg_key` and `admin:public_key`.


## How to encrypt variables
Some variables are encrypted such as github [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) and `ssh_passphrase`.

Read the documentation on the ansible website for [`ansible-vault encrypt_string`](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/vault.html#use-encrypt-string-to-create-encrypted-variables-to-embed-in-yaml) to learn more about creating encrypted variables. 

The simple way of creating an encrypted string in ansible is:
```
ansible-vault encrypt_string __your_encryptyed_string__ --ask-vault-pass
```
